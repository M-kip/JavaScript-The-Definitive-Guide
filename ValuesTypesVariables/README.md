- Types are values that can be represented and manipulated in JavaScript
- Variables define a symbolic name for a value and allows the program/programmer to access and manipulate the value by            referencing the value by name

## JavaScript Types
- Javascript types are categorised into 2 types namely;
1. Primitive types
2. Object types

# Primitives types
 Primitive types fall under numbers, strings and truth values (true and false)
 null and undefined also falls under the category of primitive data types
# Objects
 Objects are a collections of properties in a key value pair format
 
 **Examples of objects**
 - Functions
 - Arrays
 - Classes

JavaScript types are further subdivided into immutables and mutable types, objects with methods and objects without methods

## Numbers
 In JavaScript there is no types to represent floating point numbers and integers
 JavaScript uses IEEE floating point format to represent integers and floating point numbers

 Numbers the appear directly in code are refered to as number literals
 JavaScript recognizes boths integer literals and hexademical literals some JavaScript interpreters 
 support octal numbers but not all interpreters have this ability

JavaScript supports simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication
division, and modulo operations for complex mathematical operations JavaScript exposes the Math object
which has methods to perform complex operations such as Square root, and power operations.

## Date and Times
 JavaScript include a Date() construcotr for creating date objects
 The date object exposes and API for simple date computations
